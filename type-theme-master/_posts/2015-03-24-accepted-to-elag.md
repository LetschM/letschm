In this talk, we will present our infrastructure which enables a seamless integration into existing systems to re-use our generated links and services. Furthermore, we give an overview of the technical and semantical challenges arising when linking publications and research data, especially how to properly describe their connection.

[Our talk](http://elag2015.org/program/infolis-2-making-data-citations-a-reality/) will be on Wednesday, June 10 at 14.30 â€“ 15.00. We hope to see you there!
