We are invited by the German Research Foundation (DFG) to present the InFoLiS project at the [**CNI 2015 Spring meeting**](http://www.cni.org/events/membership-meetings/upcoming-meeting/spring-2015/) in **Seattle**.

In [our talk](http://www.cni.org/pbs/integration-of-research-literature-and-data-infolis/), we will describe our methods for generating the links and give insight into the Linked Data infrastructure including the services we are currently building. Most importantly, we will detail how our solutions can be used by other institutions and invite all interested participants to discuss with us their ideas and thoughts on the requirements for these services to ensure broad interoperability with existing systems and infrastructures.

Our presentation will be on **Tuesday, April 14, 2015; 9:00-10:00 AM** (Olympic). Hope to see you there!
