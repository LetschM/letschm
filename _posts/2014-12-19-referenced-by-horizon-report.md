The [NMC Horizon Report 2014 - Library Edition](http://www.nmc.org/publication/nmc-horizon-report-2014-library-edition/) identifies an "Increasing Focus on Research Data Management for Publications" as one of the fast trends in academic and research libraries. As an implication, "[v]isionary leadership for research data management models is also required to determine how to best incorporate data connections into library catalogs" (p. 7). In that paragraph [our paper at the DCMI 2013](http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/pubs/article/view/3683/1906) is mentioned, where we presented "our approach to integrate metadata of research data and links between research data and publications into library catalogues" (p. 39).
